# BI-PST (Probability and Statistics)

Course description:
> The students will learn the basics of probabilistic thinking, the ability to synthesize prior and posterior information and learn to work with random variables. They will be able to to apply basic models of random variable distributions and solve applied probabilistic problems in informatics and computer science. Using the statistical induction they will be able to perform estimations of unknown distributional parameters from random sample characteristics. They will also be introduced to the methods of determining the statistical dependence of two or more random variables.
