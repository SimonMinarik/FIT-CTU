# BI-PA2 (Programming and Algorithmics 2)

Course description:
> Students know the instruments of object-oriented programming and are able to use them for specifying and implementing abstract data types (stack, queue, enlargeable array, set, table). They can implement linked structures. They learn these skills using the programming language C++. Although this is not a module of programming in C++, students are introduced with all C++ features needed to achieve the main objective (operator overloading, templates).
