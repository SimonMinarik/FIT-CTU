# BI-DBS (Database Systems)

Course description:
> Students are introduced to the database engine architecture and typical user roles. They are briefly introduced to various database models. They learn to design small databases (including integrity constraints) using a conceptual model and implement them in a relational database engine. They get a hands-on experience with the SQL language, as well as with its theoretical foundation - the relational database model. They learn the principles of normalizing a relational database schema. They understand the fundamental concepts of transaction processing, controlling parallel user access to a single data source, as well as recovering a database engine from a failure. They are briefly introduced to special ways of storing data in relational databases with respect to speed of access to large quantities of data.
